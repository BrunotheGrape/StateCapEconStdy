# StateCapEconStdy
Comparison of the economies of state capitals with state economies and the economies of cohort urban areas with similar sized workforces.  Statistics, including work force and sector size are drawn from the US Burueau of Labor Statistics Areas at a Glance data sets available at this web site:
<https://www.bls.gov/eag/home.htm>

Cohorts:
The cohort list includes 58 USBLS economic zones.
The size of the cohorts was determined by summarizing the Civilian Work Force size of all the capital cities in the study and locating the first and third quartile of the data. USBLS areas that fell between these two values were then included in as the cohorts. These locals are not evenly distributed geographically.
